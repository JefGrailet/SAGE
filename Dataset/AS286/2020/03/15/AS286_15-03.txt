SAGE (Subnet AGgrEgation) v2.0 - Time at start: 15-03-2020 14:35:19

--- Start of target pre-scanning ---
Pre-scanning with initial timeout... done.
Found a total of 2850 responsive IPs.
Second opinion with twice the timeout (5sec : 0micsec)... done.
Found a total of 21 additional responsive IPs.
--- End of target pre-scanning (15-03-2020 16:45:42) ---
Elapsed time: 2 hours 10 minutes 23 seconds
Total amount of probes: 499934
Total amount of successful probes: 7710 (1.5422%)
Total amount of discovered responsive IPs: 2871

Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS286_15-03.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 90 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
579 out of 2818 IPs with an estimated TTL (20.5465%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 14 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 96 target IPs per thread).
--- End of target scanning (15-03-2020 17:16:28) ---
Elapsed time: 30 minutes 46 seconds

--- Start of subnet inference ---
Inferring subnets... Done.
Post-processing the discovered subnets... Done.
--- End of subnet inference (15-03-2020 17:16:28) ---
Elapsed time: less than one second

Inferred subnets has been saved in the output file AS286_15-03.subnets.

--- Start of neighborhood inference ---
Collecting additional data to discover and locate neighborhoods.

1380 IPs will be used as targets for traceroute-like probing, using 256 threads (up to 6 targets per thread).
Probing the 1380 target IPs... Done.
Building initial aggregates of subnets... Done.
Discovered direct peer IP(s) for 139 aggregates.
Discovered remote peer IP(s) for 20 aggregates.
24 aggregates don't have any peer.

There are aggregates of subnets with more than one peer and/or with miscellaneous IPs observed at the same distance.
SAGE will conduct alias resolution to test whether these IPs belong to the same devices or not (peer disambiguation).
