Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS286_12-03.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 90 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
573 out of 2826 IPs with an estimated TTL (20.276%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 17 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 88 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 3 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...

Aliases discovered during subnet discovery have been written in AS286_12-03.aliases-1.

--- Start of neighborhood inference ---
Collecting additional data to discover and locate neighborhoods.

1449 IPs will be used as targets for traceroute-like probing, using 256 threads (up to 6 targets per thread).
Probing the 1449 target IPs... Done.
Building initial aggregates of subnets... Done.
Discovered direct peer IP(s) for 144 aggregates.
Discovered remote peer IP(s) for 52 aggregates.
15 aggregates don't have any peer.

There are aggregates of subnets with more than one peer and/or with miscellaneous IPs observed at the same distance.
SAGE will conduct alias resolution to test whether these IPs belong to the same devices or not (peer disambiguation).
