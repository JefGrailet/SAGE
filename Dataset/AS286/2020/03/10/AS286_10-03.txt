--- Start of target pre-scanning ---
Pre-scanning with initial timeout... done.
Found a total of 2866 responsive IPs.
Second opinion with twice the timeout (5sec : 0micsec)... done.
Found a total of 18 additional responsive IPs.
--- End of target pre-scanning (10-03-2020 18:22:34) ---
Elapsed time: 2 hours 9 minutes 32 seconds
Total amount of probes: 499918
Total amount of successful probes: 8154 (1.63107%)
Total amount of discovered responsive IPs: 2884

Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS286_10-03.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 91 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
587 out of 2827 IPs with an estimated TTL (20.7641%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 14 threads will be scheduled (from 2 to 109 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 9 aliases.

--- Start of neighborhood inference ---
Collecting additional data to discover and locate neighborhoods.

1563 IPs will be used as targets for traceroute-like probing, using 256 threads (up to 7 targets per thread).
Probing the 1563 target IPs... Done.
Building initial aggregates of subnets... Done.
Discovered direct peer IP(s) for 141 aggregates.
Discovered remote peer IP(s) for 22 aggregates.
18 aggregates don't have any peer.

There are aggregates of subnets with more than one peer and/or with miscellaneous IPs observed at the same distance.
SAGE will conduct alias resolution to test whether these IPs belong to the same devices or not (peer disambiguation).
