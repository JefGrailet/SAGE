--- Start of target pre-scanning ---
Pre-scanning with initial timeout... done.
Found a total of 2901 responsive IPs.
Second opinion with twice the timeout (5sec : 0micsec)... done.
Found a total of 13 additional responsive IPs.
--- End of target pre-scanning (10-01-2020 20:36:34) ---
Elapsed time: 2 hours 22 minutes 27 seconds
Total amount of probes: 499883
Total amount of successful probes: 8151 (1.63058%)
Total amount of discovered responsive IPs: 2914

Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS286_10-01.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 92 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
777 out of 2885 IPs with an estimated TTL (26.9324%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 19 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 99 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 5 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...

--- Start of neighborhood inference ---
Collecting additional data to discover and locate neighborhoods.

1467 IPs will be used as targets for traceroute-like probing, using 256 threads (up to 6 targets per thread).
Probing the 1467 target IPs... Done.
Building initial aggregates of subnets... Done.
Discovered direct peer IP(s) for 123 aggregates.
Discovered remote peer IP(s) for 31 aggregates.
31 aggregates don't have any peer.

There are aggregates of subnets with more than one peer and/or with miscellaneous IPs observed at the same distance.
SAGE will conduct alias resolution to test whether these IPs belong to the same devices or not (peer disambiguation).
