--- Start of target pre-scanning ---
Pre-scanning with initial timeout... done.
Found a total of 2954 responsive IPs.
Second opinion with twice the timeout (5sec : 0micsec)... done.
Found a total of 24 additional responsive IPs.

Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS286_15-01.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 94 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
631 out of 2927 IPs with an estimated TTL (21.5579%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 16 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 99 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 5 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...

Aliases discovered during subnet discovery have been written in AS286_15-01.aliases-1.

--- Start of neighborhood inference ---
Collecting additional data to discover and locate neighborhoods.

1522 IPs will be used as targets for traceroute-like probing, using 256 threads (up to 6 targets per thread).
Probing the 1522 target IPs... Done.
Building initial aggregates of subnets... Done.
Discovered direct peer IP(s) for 138 aggregates.
Discovered remote peer IP(s) for 28 aggregates.
17 aggregates don't have any peer.
Peer IPs have been adjusted for 3 aggregates using previously discovered aliases.

There are aggregates of subnets with more than one peer and/or with miscellaneous IPs observed at the same distance.
SAGE will conduct alias resolution to test whether these IPs belong to the same devices or not (peer disambiguation).
