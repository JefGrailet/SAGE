--- Start of target pre-scanning ---
Pre-scanning with initial timeout... done.
Found a total of 2786 responsive IPs.
Second opinion with twice the timeout (5sec : 0micsec)... done.
Found a total of 16 additional responsive IPs.
--- End of target pre-scanning (05-09-2020 12:25:06) ---
Elapsed time: 2 hours 9 minutes 56 seconds
Total amount of probes: 519966
Total amount of successful probes: 7993 (1.53722%)
Total amount of discovered responsive IPs: 2802

Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS286_05-09.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 88 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
637 out of 2781 IPs with an estimated TTL (22.9054%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 18 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 78 target IPs per thread).

--- Start of neighborhood inference ---
Collecting additional data to discover and locate neighborhoods.

1369 IPs will be used as targets for traceroute-like probing, using 256 threads (up to 6 targets per thread).
Probing the 1369 target IPs... Done.
Building initial aggregates of subnets... Done.
Discovered direct peer IP(s) for 156 aggregates.
Discovered remote peer IP(s) for 28 aggregates.
19 aggregates don't have any peer.

There are aggregates of subnets with more than one peer and/or with miscellaneous IPs observed at the same distance.
SAGE will conduct alias resolution to test whether these IPs belong to the same devices or not (peer disambiguation).
