--- Start of target pre-scanning ---
Pre-scanning with initial timeout... done.
Found a total of 2777 responsive IPs.
Second opinion with twice the timeout (5sec : 0micsec)... done.
Found a total of 31 additional responsive IPs.

Total amount of discovered responsive IPs: 2808

Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS286_22-09.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 88 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
665 out of 2783 IPs with an estimated TTL (23.8951%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 19 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 99 target IPs per thread).

Inferred subnets has been saved in the output file AS286_22-09.subnets.

--- Start of neighborhood inference ---
Collecting additional data to discover and locate neighborhoods.

1345 IPs will be used as targets for traceroute-like probing, using 256 threads (up to 6 targets per thread).
Probing the 1345 target IPs... Done.
Building initial aggregates of subnets... Done.
Discovered direct peer IP(s) for 150 aggregates.
Discovered remote peer IP(s) for 33 aggregates.
19 aggregates don't have any peer.

There are aggregates of subnets with more than one peer and/or with miscellaneous IPs observed at the same distance.
SAGE will conduct alias resolution to test whether these IPs belong to the same devices or not (peer disambiguation).
