--- Start of target pre-scanning ---
Pre-scanning with initial timeout... done.
Found a total of 2302 responsive IPs.

Total amount of successful probes: 6979 (1.34095%)
Total amount of discovered responsive IPs: 2323

Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS286_25-03.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 73 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
555 out of 2287 IPs with an estimated TTL (24.2676%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 14 threads will be scheduled (from 3 to 86 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of one alias.
Now starting alias hints collection...
Collecting hints for 134.222.48.209, 134.222.48.211... Done.
Resolving... Done.

Fingerprints (subnet inference) have been saved in the output file AS286_25-03.fingerprints.
Aliases discovered during subnet discovery have been written in AS286_25-03.aliases-1.

--- Start of neighborhood inference ---
Collecting additional data to discover and locate neighborhoods.

1095 IPs will be used as targets for traceroute-like probing, using 256 threads (up to 5 targets per thread).
Probing the 1095 target IPs... Done.
Building initial aggregates of subnets... Done.
Discovered direct peer IP(s) for 119 aggregates.
Discovered remote peer IP(s) for 25 aggregates.
14 aggregates don't have any peer.

There are aggregates of subnets with more than one peer and/or with miscellaneous IPs observed at the same distance.
SAGE will conduct alias resolution to test whether these IPs belong to the same devices or not (peer disambiguation).
