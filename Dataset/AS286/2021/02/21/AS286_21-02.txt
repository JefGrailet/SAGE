SAGE (Subnet AGgrEgation) v2.0 - Time at start: 21-02-2021 19:37:28

--- Start of target pre-scanning ---
Pre-scanning with initial timeout... done.
Found a total of 2401 responsive IPs.
Second opinion with twice the timeout (5sec : 0micsec)... done.
Found a total of 18 additional responsive IPs.
--- End of target pre-scanning (21-02-2021 21:47:17) ---
Elapsed time: 2 hours 9 minutes 44 seconds
Total amount of probes: 520351
Total amount of successful probes: 8567 (1.64639%)
Total amount of discovered responsive IPs: 2419

Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS286_21-02.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 76 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
540 out of 2399 IPs with an estimated TTL (22.5094%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 11 threads will be scheduled (from 2 to 139 target IPs per thread).
--- End of target scanning (21-02-2021 22:25:25) ---
Elapsed time: 38 minutes 8 seconds
Total amount of probes: 14342

Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS286_21-02.ips.

--- Start of subnet inference ---
Inferring subnets... Done.
Post-processing the discovered subnets... Done.
--- End of subnet inference (21-02-2021 22:25:25) ---
Elapsed time: less than one second

Inferred subnets has been saved in the output file AS286_21-02.subnets.

--- Start of neighborhood inference ---
Collecting additional data to discover and locate neighborhoods.

1150 IPs will be used as targets for traceroute-like probing, using 256 threads (up to 5 targets per thread).
Probing the 1150 target IPs... Done.
Building initial aggregates of subnets... Done.
Discovered direct peer IP(s) for 123 aggregates.
Discovered remote peer IP(s) for 22 aggregates.
14 aggregates don't have any peer.

There are aggregates of subnets with more than one peer and/or with miscellaneous IPs observed at the same distance.
SAGE will conduct alias resolution to test whether these IPs belong to the same devices or not (peer disambiguation).
