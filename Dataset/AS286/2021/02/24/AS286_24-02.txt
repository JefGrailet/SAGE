SAGE (Subnet AGgrEgation) v2.0 - Time at start: 24-02-2021 09:48:01

--- Start of target pre-scanning ---
Pre-scanning with initial timeout... done.
Found a total of 2413 responsive IPs.
Second opinion with twice the timeout (5sec : 0micsec)... done.
Found a total of 19 additional responsive IPs.
--- End of target pre-scanning (24-02-2021 11:57:58) ---
Elapsed time: 2 hours 9 minutes 52 seconds
Total amount of probes: 520339
Total amount of successful probes: 7955 (1.52881%)
Total amount of discovered responsive IPs: 2432

Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS286_24-02.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 76 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
578 out of 2410 IPs with an estimated TTL (23.9834%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 11 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 85 target IPs per thread).
--- End of target scanning (24-02-2021 12:26:29) ---
Elapsed time: 28 minutes 31 seconds

Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS286_24-02.ips.

--- Start of subnet inference ---
Inferring subnets... Done.
Post-processing the discovered subnets... Done.

Elapsed time: 1 second

Inferred subnets has been saved in the output file AS286_24-02.subnets.

--- Start of neighborhood inference ---
Collecting additional data to discover and locate neighborhoods.

1167 IPs will be used as targets for traceroute-like probing, using 256 threads (up to 5 targets per thread).
Probing the 1167 target IPs... Done.
Building initial aggregates of subnets... Done.
Discovered direct peer IP(s) for 121 aggregates.
Discovered remote peer IP(s) for 24 aggregates.
14 aggregates don't have any peer.

There are aggregates of subnets with more than one peer and/or with miscellaneous IPs observed at the same distance.
SAGE will conduct alias resolution to test whether these IPs belong to the same devices or not (peer disambiguation).
