SAGE (Subnet AGgrEgation) v2.0 - Time at start: 15-04-2021 06:45:27

--- Start of target pre-scanning ---
Pre-scanning with initial timeout... done.
Found a total of 158306 responsive IPs.
Second opinion with twice the timeout (2sec : 0micsec)... done.
Found a total of 1081 additional responsive IPs.

Elapsed time: 8 hours 7 minutes 44 seconds
Total amount of probes: 5130142
Total amount of successful probes: 252020 (4.91253%)
Total amount of discovered responsive IPs: 159387

Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS286_15-04.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 622 target IPs per thread).
5290 out of 5505 IPs with an estimated TTL (96.0945%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 56 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 368 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of one alias.
Now starting alias hints collection...

Inferred subnets has been saved in the output file AS286_15-04.subnets.
Alias hints (subnet inference) have been saved in the output file AS286_15-04.hints.
Fingerprints (subnet inference) have been saved in the output file AS286_15-04.fingerprints.

--- Start of neighborhood inference ---
Collecting additional data to discover and locate neighborhoods.

1209 IPs will be used as targets for traceroute-like probing, using 256 threads (up to 5 targets per thread).
Probing the 1209 target IPs... Done.
Building initial aggregates of subnets... Done.
Discovered direct peer IP(s) for 10 aggregates.
Discovered remote peer IP(s) for 2 aggregates.
106 aggregates don't have any peer.

There are aggregates of subnets with more than one peer and/or with miscellaneous IPs observed at the same distance.
SAGE will conduct alias resolution to test whether these IPs belong to the same devices or not (peer disambiguation).

Collecting hints for 149.235.16.230, 149.235.16.238... Done.
No alias could be discovered.
Building the vertices of the graph... Done.
Building the edges of the graph... Done.
