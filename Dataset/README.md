# Dataset

*By Jean-Fran√ßois Grailet (last updated: November 29, 2021)*

## About

The data provided in this repository consists in separate sets of files collected for a variety of 
Autonomous Systems (or ASes) at specific dates. Each set of files (or _snapshot_) was obtained by 
running a single instance of `SAGE` from a single vantage point.

A few remarks about this public dataset:

* Each AS sub-folder contains a target file named after the AS and suffixed in `.txt`. Such a file 
  provides all IPv4 prefixes associated to the AS, with one prefix per line.

* The IPv4 prefixes were obtained via the BGP toolkit of Hurricane Electric. You can access 
  and use the BGP toolkit at the following address:
  
  http://bgp.he.net

* Our target ASes are selected to be representative, i.e., they encompass Tier-1, Transit as well 
  as Stub ASes. In particular, some Transit/Tier-1 were selected with the help of CAIDA's AS Rank, 
  which is available at the following address:
  
  https://asrank.caida.org/

* For the sake of reproducibility, we also provide in a **Scripts/** sub-repository the bash 
  scripts and the typical files we used to schedule and retrieve our measurements.

* An additional `Miscellaneous.md` file provides various remarks about how the measurements were 
  planned or performed.

* Finally, a **Archives/** sub-repository provides older target files as well as scripts we used 
  when `SAGE` was still being deployed from the PlanetLab testbed.

## About the testbeds and measurement scheduling

The snapshots provided in this repository were collected from both the 
[PlanetLab testbed](https://planet-lab.eu/) and the [EdgeNet cluster](https://edge-net.org/). 
Indeed, [PlanetLab termination was announced during 2020](https://www.systemsapproach.org/blog/its-been-a-fun-ride), 
so the earliest snapshots collected with `SAGE` were still using vantage points from PlanetLab 
(until March 2020 included), but starting from September 2020, all snapshots were collected from 
the EdgeNet cluster.

It is worth noting that, due to the low amount of PlanetLab nodes that were still working for 
the past two years, the measurements run from PlanetLab were organized as campaigns to make 
the most out of the available nodes. During such campaigns, vantage points were rotated between 
each snapshot, therefore ensuring each snapshot for a given AS was collected from a different 
vantage point. This scheduling strategy is actually identical to the strategy used to collect 
data with [`WISE`](https://github.com/JefGrailet/WISE). More details about PlanetLab campaigns 
are provided in the *Archives/PlanetLab/* sub-repository.

The snapshots collected from EdgeNet do not follow such a scheme, but our selection of the 
vantage point upon scheduling a measurement typically makes sure the selected EdgeNet node was 
never used before to probe the given AS or that the amount of snapshots collected from this 
vantage point is the lowest among available nodes.

## Composition of this dataset

For each AS sub-folder, you will find one or several `.txt` files listing the IPv4 prefixes 
retrieved with the BGP toolkit from Hurricane Electric along with sub-folders matching with the 
year and date of each measurement. Each unique set of files (or _snapshot_, see below) is matched 
with a sub-path /yyyy/mm/dd/.

### Typical content of a snapshot

A dataset for a given autonomous system consists of several _snapshots_ which are collections of 
files computed during a single measurement of said AS from a single vantage point (or VP) using a 
single instance of `SAGE`. Each snapshot is isolated by date of measurement and consists of up to 
13 distinct files. Each file can be identified by its extension or full name.

**Remark (terminology):** an IP address is considered _lower_ when its 32-bit integer equivalent 
is lower than another address displayed in the same format. In practice, an IP address is lower 
than another when it contains the same first bytes then a lower byte (or when the first byte is 
lower). For example, `1.2.3.5` is lower than both `1.2.3.6` and `2.2.3.5`.

* `.aliases-1` **file:** contains all the aliases discovered during the preliminary step of subnet 
  inference (flickering IPs aliasing).
* `.aliases-2` **file:** contains all the aliases discovered during the neighborhood graph 
  inference (peer IPs aliasing).
* `.aliases-f` **file:** contains all the aliases discovered for each neighborhood during the full 
  alias resolution step (contra-pivot/peer IPs aliasing). Such aliases are listed by neighborhood.
* `.fingerprints`: contains all the fingerprints for each IP involved in alias resolution. 
  Only one fingerprint is given per IP because it's assumed a fingerprint doesn't change over time 
  (contrary to alias resolution hints themselves, in particular IP-IDs).
* `.graph` **file:** describes the neighborhood graph inferred by `SAGE`. The file can be split in 
  three parts: the first part lists all vertices along with the label of their respective 
  neighborhood, the second part describes the edges and the third and last part lists the 
  miscellaneous routes which implements _remote_ links (i.e. paths between two neighborhoods 
  located more than one hop from each other, for which no intermediate neighborhood could be 
  discovered).
* `.hints` **file:** contains the alias resolution hints collected for each IP involved in alias 
  resolution. Each line starts with the IP suffixed by the algorithmical step during which the 
  hints were collected, both as an additional piece of information and in order to discriminate 
  sets of hints for a same IP from each other.
* `.ips` **file:** lists all IPs that were discovered during pre-scanning along their associated
  data (i.e., IP dictionary), with the _lowest_ IPs coming first. Special IPs (e.g. IPs which 
  appeared at different hop counts) are annotated with additional details.
* `.metrics` **file:** provides an early set of metrics on the graph inferred by `SAGE`, such as 
  the maximum degree of a vertex, as well as a short description of the connected components 
  (plus how many vertices they gather as a ratio).
* `.neighborhoods` **file:** lists all the neighborhoods that were inferred along with their 
  associated subnets, ordered w.r.t. their (first) label IP address (i.e. _lowest_ IPs first), 
  with the neighborhoods based on incomplete or echoing _trails_ coming first (_lowest_ IPs then 
  lowest anomaly or pre-echoing counts first).
* `.peers` **file:** contains the results of the partial (Paris) `traceroute` measurements used to 
  perform neighborhood inference.
* `.subnets` **file:** lists all the subnets that were inferred along with their responsive 
  interfaces, ordered w.r.t. their prefix IP (i.e. _lowest_ prefix IP addresses first).
* `.txt` **file:** gives the details about how the measurement went, e.g., it gives the detailed 
  amount of probes used by each phase along the time they took for completion. This corresponds, 
  in fact, to the console output of `SAGE`.
* `VP.txt` **file:** gives the host name of the **v**antage **p**oint used to measure the AS on 
  that specific date.

In rare instances, these files might be complemented by one additional `README` file in case there 
was something unusual about the measurement (such as having to restart it due to a temporar 
failure).

## Special remarks

* Up to late September 2020, the `.graph` files might list (in)direct links with a _medium_ (i.e., 
  a subnet which might be the real-life link) connecting a neighborhood `u` to a neighborhood `v` 
  where `v` is bordered by subnets built with the third rule of subnet inference (_echoing_ 
  trails). Such links shouldn't actually have a _medium_ at all since the last route hops towards 
  subnets like those of `v` are _echoing_ and therefore hiding the actual router interface. 
  Therefore, while parsing a `.graph`, the _medium_ associated to any link pointing towards a 
  neighborhood comparable to the aforementioned `v` can be ignored. As of October 12, 2020, the 
  public code of `SAGE` no longer searches a _medium_ for such links.

* Various comments in the code, variable names or metrics denotes an _alias_ as the complete list 
  of IPs that could be aliased with each others. This is kind of a language abuse: usually, in the 
  scientific literature, the term _alias list_ is preferred, while an _alias pair_ (also fairly 
  common) denotes two IPs that were aliased with each other. Therefore, when a `.metrics` file 
  mentions the _maximum size of an alias_, it means of course the maximum amount of IPs that could 
  be aliased with each others, i.e., the maximum amount of IPs found in a same _alias list_.
