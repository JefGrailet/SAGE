Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS8928_19-03.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 142 target IPs per thread).
5997 out of 36280 IPs with an estimated TTL (16.5298%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 56 threads will be scheduled (from 2 to 504 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 11 aliases.

--- Start of neighborhood inference ---
Collecting additional data to discover and locate neighborhoods.

19801 IPs will be used as targets for traceroute-like probing, using 256 threads (up to 78 targets per thread).
Probing the 19801 target IPs... Done.
Building initial aggregates of subnets... Done.
Discovered direct peer IP(s) for 1287 aggregates.
Discovered remote peer IP(s) for 255 aggregates.
167 aggregates don't have any peer.
Peer IPs have been adjusted for 3 aggregates using previously discovered aliases.

There are aggregates of subnets with more than one peer and/or with miscellaneous IPs observed at the same distance.
SAGE will conduct alias resolution to test whether these IPs belong to the same devices or not (peer disambiguation).
