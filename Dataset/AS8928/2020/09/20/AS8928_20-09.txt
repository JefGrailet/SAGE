SAGE (Subnet AGgrEgation) v2.0 - Time at start: 20-09-2020 11:01:54

--- Start of target pre-scanning ---
Pre-scanning with initial timeout... done.
Found a total of 1975 responsive IPs.
Second opinion with twice the timeout (5sec : 0micsec)... done.
Found a total of 10 additional responsive IPs.
--- End of target pre-scanning (20-09-2020 11:12:27) ---
Elapsed time: 10 minutes 33 seconds
Total amount of probes: 27721
Total amount of successful probes: 4162 (15.0139%)
Total amount of discovered responsive IPs: 1985

Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS8928_20-09.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 63 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
1630 out of 1985 IPs with an estimated TTL (82.1159%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 7 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 401 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of one alias.
Now starting alias hints collection...
Collecting hints for 81.212.30.43, 212.175.18.18... Done.
Resolving... Done.

--- Start of subnet inference ---
Inferring subnets... Done.
Post-processing the discovered subnets... Done.

Fingerprints (subnet inference) have been saved in the output file AS8928_20-09.fingerprints.

--- Start of neighborhood inference ---
Collecting additional data to discover and locate neighborhoods.

120 IPs will be used as targets for traceroute-like probing, using 120 threads (one target per thread).
Probing the 120 target IPs... Done.
Building initial aggregates of subnets... Done.
Discovered direct peer IP(s) for 7 aggregates.
Discovered remote peer IP(s) for 2 aggregates.
10 aggregates don't have any peer.

There are aggregates of subnets with more than one peer and/or with miscellaneous IPs observed at the same distance.
SAGE will conduct alias resolution to test whether these IPs belong to the same devices or not (peer disambiguation).

Collecting hints for 81.212.30.43, 81.212.213.251... Done.
Collecting hints for 217.5.66.66, 217.5.66.70, 217.5.66.74, 217.5.66.78, 217.5.66.82, 217.5.66.86... Done.
One alias could be discovered.

Identified one aggregate with blindspots (previously unidentified peers).
Building the vertices of the graph... Done.
Building the edges of the graph... Done.
