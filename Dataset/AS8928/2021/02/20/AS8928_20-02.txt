--- Start of target pre-scanning ---
Pre-scanning with initial timeout... done.
Found a total of 1973 responsive IPs.
Second opinion with twice the timeout (5sec : 0micsec)... done.
Didn't find any additional responsive IP.

Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS8928_20-02.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 62 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
1603 out of 1958 IPs with an estimated TTL (81.8693%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 7 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 433 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of one alias.
Now starting alias hints collection...
Collecting hints for 170.178.155.3, 199.166.25.45, 199.166.26.40, 199.166.26.217, 199.166.26.246, 199.166.28.74, 199.166.28.99, 199.166.28.103, 199.166.29.11, 199.166.29.171... Done.
