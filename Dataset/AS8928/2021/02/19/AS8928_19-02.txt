--- Start of target pre-scanning ---
Pre-scanning with initial timeout... done.
Found a total of 1970 responsive IPs.
Second opinion with twice the timeout (5sec : 0micsec)... done.
Found a total of 4 additional responsive IPs.

Total amount of successful probes: 3905 (14.0843%)
Total amount of discovered responsive IPs: 1974

Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS8928_19-02.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 62 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
1390 out of 1974 IPs with an estimated TTL (70.4154%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 6 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 347 target IPs per thread).

Elapsed time: 2 seconds

Inferred subnets has been saved in the output file AS8928_19-02.subnets.

--- Start of neighborhood inference ---
Collecting additional data to discover and locate neighborhoods.

132 IPs will be used as targets for traceroute-like probing, using 132 threads (one target per thread).
Probing the 132 target IPs... Done.
Building initial aggregates of subnets... Done.
Discovered direct peer IP(s) for 7 aggregates.
Discovered remote peer IP(s) for 3 aggregates.
6 aggregates don't have any peer.

There are aggregates of subnets with more than one peer and/or with miscellaneous IPs observed at the same distance.
SAGE will conduct alias resolution to test whether these IPs belong to the same devices or not (peer disambiguation).

Collecting hints for 62.154.28.98, 217.5.66.78, 217.5.66.78, 217.5.66.82, 217.5.66.86, 217.5.66.86... Done.
2 aliases could be discovered.
Building the vertices of the graph... Done.
Building the edges of the graph... Done.
