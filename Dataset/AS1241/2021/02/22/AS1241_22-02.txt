--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 444 target IPs per thread).
2517 out of 108854 IPs with an estimated TTL (2.31227%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 56 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 103 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 19 aliases.

Collecting additional data to discover and locate neighborhoods.

30165 IPs will be used as targets for traceroute-like probing, using 256 threads (up to 118 targets per thread).
Probing the 30165 target IPs... Done.
Building initial aggregates of subnets... Done.
Discovered direct peer IP(s) for 760 aggregates.
Discovered remote peer IP(s) for 72 aggregates.
95 aggregates don't have any peer.
Peer IPs have been adjusted for 258 aggregates using previously discovered aliases.

There are aggregates of subnets with more than one peer and/or with miscellaneous IPs observed at the same distance.
SAGE will conduct alias resolution to test whether these IPs belong to the same devices or not (peer disambiguation).
