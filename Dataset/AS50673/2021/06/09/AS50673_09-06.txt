Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS50673_09-06.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 259 threads will be scheduled (up to 83 target IPs per thread).
1080 out of 21351 IPs with an estimated TTL (5.05831%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 21 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 185 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 13 aliases.

Peer IPs have been adjusted for 33 aggregates using previously discovered aliases.

There are aggregates of subnets with more than one peer and/or with miscellaneous IPs observed at the same distance.
SAGE will conduct alias resolution to test whether these IPs belong to the same devices or not (peer disambiguation).
