Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS50673_01-03.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 259 threads will be scheduled (up to 87 target IPs per thread).
1932 out of 22421 IPs with an estimated TTL (8.61692%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 37 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 165 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 14 aliases.

6739 IPs will be used as targets for traceroute-like probing, using 256 threads (up to 27 targets per thread).
Probing the 6739 target IPs... Done.
Building initial aggregates of subnets... Done.
Discovered direct peer IP(s) for 135 aggregates.
Discovered remote peer IP(s) for 14 aggregates.
14 aggregates don't have any peer.
Peer IPs have been adjusted for 29 aggregates using previously discovered aliases.

There are aggregates of subnets with more than one peer and/or with miscellaneous IPs observed at the same distance.
SAGE will conduct alias resolution to test whether these IPs belong to the same devices or not (peer disambiguation).
