Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS50673_15-04.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 79 target IPs per thread).
15439 out of 17476 IPs with an estimated TTL (88.344%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 125 threads will be scheduled (from 4 to 461 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 5 aliases.

Aliases discovered during subnet discovery have been written in AS50673_15-04.aliases-1.

--- Start of neighborhood inference ---
Collecting additional data to discover and locate neighborhoods.

6624 IPs will be used as targets for traceroute-like probing, using 256 threads (up to 26 targets per thread).
Probing the 6624 target IPs... Done.
Building initial aggregates of subnets... Done.
Discovered direct peer IP(s) for 23 aggregates.
Discovered remote peer IP(s) for 11 aggregates.
67 aggregates don't have any peer.
Peer IPs have been adjusted for 6 aggregates using previously discovered aliases.

There are aggregates of subnets with more than one peer and/or with miscellaneous IPs observed at the same distance.
SAGE will conduct alias resolution to test whether these IPs belong to the same devices or not (peer disambiguation).

Collecting hints for 185.8.179.37, 185.8.179.38... Done.
No alias could be discovered.
Building the vertices of the graph... Done.
