--- Start of target pre-scanning ---
Pre-scanning with initial timeout... done.
Found a total of 20215 responsive IPs.
Second opinion with twice the timeout (5sec : 0micsec)... done.
Found a total of 120 additional responsive IPs.
--- End of target pre-scanning (21-04-2021 07:45:43) ---
Elapsed time: 42 minutes 56 seconds
Total amount of probes: 174857
Total amount of successful probes: 25468 (14.565%)
Total amount of discovered responsive IPs: 20335

Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS50673_21-04.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 258 threads will be scheduled (up to 79 target IPs per thread).
7489 out of 12315 IPs with an estimated TTL (60.812%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 95 threads will be scheduled (from 3 to 410 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 9 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...

--- Start of neighborhood inference ---
Collecting additional data to discover and locate neighborhoods.

2033 IPs will be used as targets for traceroute-like probing, using 256 threads (up to 8 targets per thread).
Probing the 2033 target IPs... Done.
Building initial aggregates of subnets... Done.
Discovered direct peer IP(s) for 51 aggregates.
51 aggregates don't have any peer.
Peer IPs have been adjusted for 16 aggregates using previously discovered aliases.

There are aggregates of subnets with more than one peer and/or with miscellaneous IPs observed at the same distance.
SAGE will conduct alias resolution to test whether these IPs belong to the same devices or not (peer disambiguation).
