SAGE (Subnet AGgrEgation) v2.0 - Time at start: 21-04-2021 07:02:34

--- Start of target pre-scanning ---
Pre-scanning with initial timeout... done.
Found a total of 7855 responsive IPs.
Second opinion with twice the timeout (5sec : 0micsec)... done.
Found a total of 6 additional responsive IPs.

Elapsed time: 45 minutes 54 seconds
Total amount of probes: 181073
Total amount of successful probes: 15527 (8.57499%)
Total amount of discovered responsive IPs: 7861

Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS13789_21-04.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 246 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
619 out of 3539 IPs with an estimated TTL (17.4908%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 16 threads will be scheduled (from 4 to 75 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 7 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...

--- Start of neighborhood inference ---
Collecting additional data to discover and locate neighborhoods.

1512 IPs will be used as targets for traceroute-like probing, using 256 threads (up to 6 targets per thread).
Probing the 1512 target IPs... Done.
Building initial aggregates of subnets... Done.
Discovered direct peer IP(s) for 85 aggregates.
Discovered remote peer IP(s) for 8 aggregates.
50 aggregates don't have any peer.
Peer IPs have been adjusted for 11 aggregates using previously discovered aliases.

There are aggregates of subnets with more than one peer and/or with miscellaneous IPs observed at the same distance.
SAGE will conduct alias resolution to test whether these IPs belong to the same devices or not (peer disambiguation).
