Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS13789_01-04.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 242 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
19 out of 161 IPs with an estimated TTL (11.8012%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 4 threads will be scheduled (from 2 to 8 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of one alias.
Now starting alias hints collection...
Collecting hints for 64.94.172.108, 74.201.136.18... Done.
Resolving... Done.
