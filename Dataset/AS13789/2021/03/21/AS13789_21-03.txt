--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 245 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
21 out of 73 IPs with an estimated TTL (28.7671%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 2 threads will be scheduled (from 3 to 18 target IPs per thread).
