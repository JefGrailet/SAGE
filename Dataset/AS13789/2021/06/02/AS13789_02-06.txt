--- Start of target pre-scanning ---
Pre-scanning with initial timeout... done.
Found a total of 7905 responsive IPs.
Second opinion with twice the timeout (5sec : 0micsec)... done.
Found a total of 5 additional responsive IPs.

Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS13789_02-06.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 248 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
1450 out of 7256 IPs with an estimated TTL (19.9835%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 27 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 181 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 14 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...

--- Start of neighborhood inference ---
Collecting additional data to discover and locate neighborhoods.

3320 IPs will be used as targets for traceroute-like probing, using 256 threads (up to 13 targets per thread).
Probing the 3320 target IPs... Done.
Building initial aggregates of subnets... Done.
Discovered direct peer IP(s) for 114 aggregates.
Discovered remote peer IP(s) for 62 aggregates.
131 aggregates don't have any peer.
Peer IPs have been adjusted for 14 aggregates using previously discovered aliases.

There are aggregates of subnets with more than one peer and/or with miscellaneous IPs observed at the same distance.
SAGE will conduct alias resolution to test whether these IPs belong to the same devices or not (peer disambiguation).
