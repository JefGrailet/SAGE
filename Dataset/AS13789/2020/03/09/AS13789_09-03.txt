--- Start of target pre-scanning ---
Pre-scanning with initial timeout... done.
Found a total of 7164 responsive IPs.
Second opinion with twice the timeout (5sec : 0micsec)... done.
Found a total of 6 additional responsive IPs.
--- End of target pre-scanning (09-03-2020 10:11:16) ---
Elapsed time: 47 minutes 31 seconds
Total amount of probes: 185348
Total amount of successful probes: 13947 (7.52476%)
Total amount of discovered responsive IPs: 7170

Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS13789_09-03.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 225 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
1568 out of 7158 IPs with an estimated TTL (21.9056%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 34 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 116 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 12 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...

Building initial aggregates of subnets... Done.
Discovered direct peer IP(s) for 144 aggregates.
Discovered remote peer IP(s) for 32 aggregates.
106 aggregates don't have any peer.
Peer IPs have been adjusted for 32 aggregates using previously discovered aliases.

There are aggregates of subnets with more than one peer and/or with miscellaneous IPs observed at the same distance.
SAGE will conduct alias resolution to test whether these IPs belong to the same devices or not (peer disambiguation).
