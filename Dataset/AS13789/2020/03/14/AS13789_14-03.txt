Elapsed time: 47 minutes 44 seconds
Total amount of probes: 185334
Total amount of successful probes: 14434 (7.7881%)
Total amount of discovered responsive IPs: 7184

Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS13789_14-03.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 225 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
1575 out of 7173 IPs with an estimated TTL (21.9573%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 31 threads will be scheduled (from 2 to 120 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 9 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...

3354 IPs will be used as targets for traceroute-like probing, using 256 threads (up to 14 targets per thread).
Probing the 3354 target IPs... Done.
Building initial aggregates of subnets... Done.
Discovered direct peer IP(s) for 140 aggregates.
Discovered remote peer IP(s) for 43 aggregates.
82 aggregates don't have any peer.
Peer IPs have been adjusted for 47 aggregates using previously discovered aliases.

There are aggregates of subnets with more than one peer and/or with miscellaneous IPs observed at the same distance.
SAGE will conduct alias resolution to test whether these IPs belong to the same devices or not (peer disambiguation).
