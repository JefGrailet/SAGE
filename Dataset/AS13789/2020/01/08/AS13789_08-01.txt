Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS13789_08-01.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 230 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
1602 out of 7333 IPs with an estimated TTL (21.8464%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 30 threads will be scheduled (from 2 to 119 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 9 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...

3431 IPs will be used as targets for traceroute-like probing, using 256 threads (up to 14 targets per thread).
Probing the 3431 target IPs... Done.
Building initial aggregates of subnets... Done.
Discovered direct peer IP(s) for 136 aggregates.
Discovered remote peer IP(s) for 44 aggregates.
78 aggregates don't have any peer.
Peer IPs have been adjusted for 53 aggregates using previously discovered aliases.

There are aggregates of subnets with more than one peer and/or with miscellaneous IPs observed at the same distance.
SAGE will conduct alias resolution to test whether these IPs belong to the same devices or not (peer disambiguation).
