--- Start of target pre-scanning ---
Pre-scanning with initial timeout... done.
Found a total of 7324 responsive IPs.
Second opinion with twice the timeout (5sec : 0micsec)... done.
Found a total of 7 additional responsive IPs.
--- End of target pre-scanning (01-01-2020 12:42:21) ---
Elapsed time: 47 minutes 26 seconds
Total amount of probes: 185188
Total amount of successful probes: 14045 (7.58418%)
Total amount of discovered responsive IPs: 7331

Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS13789_01-01.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 230 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
1597 out of 7320 IPs with an estimated TTL (21.8169%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 34 threads will be scheduled (from 3 to 118 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 13 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...

99 aggregates don't have any peer.
Peer IPs have been adjusted for 28 aggregates using previously discovered aliases.

There are aggregates of subnets with more than one peer and/or with miscellaneous IPs observed at the same distance.
SAGE will conduct alias resolution to test whether these IPs belong to the same devices or not (peer disambiguation).
