--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 368 target IPs per thread).
74 out of 77 IPs with an estimated TTL (96.1039%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 5 threads will be scheduled (from 2 to 42 target IPs per thread).
