This snapshot was actually captured on 16/01/2020 (and downloaded on 17/01/2020). It was a bis 
measurement of the same AS from the same PlanetLab node as on 12/01/2020 because the original 
measurement couldn't be completed due to a an unexpected malfunction of the node that couldn't be 
diagnosed accurately (because the crash occurred at a point of the program where SAGE just prints 
console messages - making the node more suspect than the program). Making this bis measurement was 
a way to ensure a proper snapshot of AS3257 from planetlabeu-1.tssg.org was available.
