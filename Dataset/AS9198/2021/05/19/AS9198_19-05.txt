Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS9198_19-05.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 2894 target IPs per thread).
1468 out of 8943 IPs with an estimated TTL (16.4151%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 9 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 310 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 2 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...

Aliases discovered during subnet discovery have been written in AS9198_19-05.aliases-1.

--- Start of neighborhood inference ---
Collecting additional data to discover and locate neighborhoods.

3077 IPs will be used as targets for traceroute-like probing, using 256 threads (up to 13 targets per thread).
Probing the 3077 target IPs... Done.
Building initial aggregates of subnets... Done.
Discovered direct peer IP(s) for 5 aggregates.
Discovered remote peer IP(s) for 54 aggregates.
6 aggregates don't have any peer.

There are aggregates of subnets with more than one peer and/or with miscellaneous IPs observed at the same distance.
SAGE will conduct alias resolution to test whether these IPs belong to the same devices or not (peer disambiguation).

Collecting hints for 82.200.243.115, 95.59.172.77... Done.
No alias could be discovered.
Building the vertices of the graph... Done.
