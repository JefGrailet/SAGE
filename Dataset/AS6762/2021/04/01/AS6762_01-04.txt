SAGE (Subnet AGgrEgation) v2.0 - Time at start: 01-04-2021 14:27:47

--- Start of target pre-scanning ---
Pre-scanning with initial timeout... done.
Found a total of 78224 responsive IPs.
Second opinion with twice the timeout (5sec : 0micsec)... done.
Found a total of 1280 additional responsive IPs.
--- End of target pre-scanning (01-04-2021 15:10:35) ---
Elapsed time: 42 minutes 46 seconds
Total amount of probes: 179312
Total amount of successful probes: 81114 (45.2362%)
Total amount of discovered responsive IPs: 79504

Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS6762_01-04.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 310 target IPs per thread).
10035 out of 72371 IPs with an estimated TTL (13.8661%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 91 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 457 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 20 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...

Peer IPs have been adjusted for 60 aggregates using previously discovered aliases.

There are aggregates of subnets with more than one peer and/or with miscellaneous IPs observed at the same distance.
SAGE will conduct alias resolution to test whether these IPs belong to the same devices or not (peer disambiguation).
