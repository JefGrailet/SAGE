## About

This part of the repository provides several sub-repositories containing older resources related 
to measurements with `SAGE`. There are currently two sub-repositories.

* *Targets/* provides older target files, i.e., target files we used for a certain period of time 
  before refreshing them by re-using the [BGP toolkit of Hurricane Electric](http://bgp.he.net).

* *PlanetLab/* provides older material for deploying `SAGE` on the 
  [PlanetLab testbed](https://planet-lab.eu/), as well as some details about earlier measurement 
  campaigns with `SAGE` from this testbed.
