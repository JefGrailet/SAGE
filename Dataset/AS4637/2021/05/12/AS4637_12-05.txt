SAGE (Subnet AGgrEgation) v2.0 - Time at start: 12-05-2021 11:51:06

--- Start of target pre-scanning ---
Pre-scanning with initial timeout... done.
Found a total of 14559 responsive IPs.
Second opinion with twice the timeout (5sec : 0micsec)... done.
Found a total of 20 additional responsive IPs.
--- End of target pre-scanning (12-05-2021 16:02:31) ---
Elapsed time: 4 hours 11 minutes 13 seconds
Total amount of probes: 1035553
Total amount of successful probes: 33191 (3.20515%)
Total amount of discovered responsive IPs: 14579

Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS4637_12-05.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 261 threads will be scheduled (up to 56 target IPs per thread).
131 out of 225 IPs with an estimated TTL (58.2222%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 8 threads will be scheduled (from 3 to 69 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of one alias.
Now starting alias hints collection...
Collecting hints for 202.84.137.250, 202.84.137.253... Done.
Resolving... Done.

Fingerprints (subnet inference) have been saved in the output file AS4637_12-05.fingerprints.
Aliases discovered during subnet discovery have been written in AS4637_12-05.aliases-1.

--- Start of neighborhood inference ---
Collecting additional data to discover and locate neighborhoods.

107 IPs will be used as targets for traceroute-like probing, using 107 threads (one target per thread).
Probing the 107 target IPs... Done.
Building initial aggregates of subnets... Done.
Discovered direct peer IP(s) for 8 aggregates.
22 aggregates don't have any peer.

There are aggregates of subnets with more than one peer and/or with miscellaneous IPs observed at the same distance.
SAGE will conduct alias resolution to test whether these IPs belong to the same devices or not (peer disambiguation).

Collecting hints for 202.84.178.54, 202.84.178.66... Done.
One alias could be discovered.

Identified one aggregate with blindspots (previously unidentified peers).
Building the vertices of the graph... Done.
Building the edges of the graph... Done.
