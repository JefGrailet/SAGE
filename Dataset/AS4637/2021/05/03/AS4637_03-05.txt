SAGE (Subnet AGgrEgation) v2.0 - Time at start: 03-05-2021 07:54:42

--- Start of target pre-scanning ---
Pre-scanning with initial timeout... done.
Found a total of 14539 responsive IPs.
Second opinion with twice the timeout (5sec : 0micsec)... done.
Found a total of 12 additional responsive IPs.
--- End of target pre-scanning (03-05-2021 12:05:27) ---
Elapsed time: 4 hours 10 minutes 33 seconds
Total amount of probes: 1035573
Total amount of successful probes: 34495 (3.33101%)
Total amount of discovered responsive IPs: 14551

Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS4637_03-05.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 260 threads will be scheduled (up to 56 target IPs per thread).
52 out of 176 IPs with an estimated TTL (29.5455%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 5 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 39 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of one alias.
Now starting alias hints collection...
Collecting hints for 125.252.104.195, 203.192.167.121... Done.
Resolving... Done.

--- Start of subnet inference ---
Inferring subnets... Done.
Post-processing the discovered subnets... Done.

Inferred subnets has been saved in the output file AS4637_03-05.subnets.
Alias hints (subnet inference) have been saved in the output file AS4637_03-05.hints.
Fingerprints (subnet inference) have been saved in the output file AS4637_03-05.fingerprints.

--- Start of neighborhood inference ---
Collecting additional data to discover and locate neighborhoods.

90 IPs will be used as targets for traceroute-like probing, using 90 threads (one target per thread).
Probing the 90 target IPs... Done.
Building initial aggregates of subnets... Done.
Discovered direct peer IP(s) for 9 aggregates.
Discovered remote peer IP(s) for one aggregate.
19 aggregates don't have any peer.

There are aggregates of subnets with more than one peer and/or with miscellaneous IPs observed at the same distance.
SAGE will conduct alias resolution to test whether these IPs belong to the same devices or not (peer disambiguation).

Collecting hints for 202.84.153.26, 202.84.157.37... Done.
Collecting hints for 202.84.252.50, 202.84.252.142... Done.
One alias could be discovered.
Building the vertices of the graph... Done.
Building the edges of the graph... Done.
