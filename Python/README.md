# Python scripts for `SAGE`

*By Jean-Fran√ßois Grailet (last updated: June 30, 2021)*

## About

**N.B.:** if you reached this part of the repository via a direct link, please note that this 
sub-folder does not provide the data collected by `SAGE` nor its source code. You will rather find 
them respectively in the **Dataset/** and **src/** sub-folders at the root of this repository.

This part of the repository provides several sub-repositories containing various Python scripts to 
evaluate or visualize the data collected with `SAGE`. Most of these scripts produce figures to 
better visualize the data as captured by `SAGE` or the output of the script if said script 
performs some additional processing on the data captured by `SAGE`. Most figures that were 
generated on the basis of the publicly available data are included as well.

Each sub-repository comes with the Python scripts themselves, additional Shell scripts (when 
relevant) and additional sub-folders providing the generated figures. Additional README files 
are provided as well to give some commentary and instructions.
