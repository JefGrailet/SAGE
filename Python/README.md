# Python scripts for `SAGE`

*By Jean-Fran√ßois Grailet (last updated: October 23, 2020)*

## About

**N.B.:** if you reached this part of the repository via a direct link, please note that this 
sub-folder doesn't provide the data collected by `SAGE` nor its source code. You will rather find 
them respectively in the **Dataset/** and **src/** sub-folders at the root of this repository.

This part of the repository provides several sub-folders that contain various Python scripts to 
evaluate or visualize the data collected with `SAGE`. Most of these scripts produce figures to 
better visualize the data collected by `SAGE` or to better picture the output of the script; when 
it's the case, figures that were generated on the basis of the publicly available data are 
provided as well.

Each sub-folder comes with the Python scripts themselves, additional Shell scripts (when relevant) 
and additional sub-folders providing all the generated figures. Additional README files are 
provided as well to give some commentary and instructions.
